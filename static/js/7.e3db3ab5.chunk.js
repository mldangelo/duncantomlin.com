In light of its remarkably heterogeneous program of ornamentation, including references to visual traditions that span the multicultural, multiconfessional history of the Iberian Peninsula, the chapel\u2019s design merits consideration, firstly, as a unique contribution to the canon of Castilian mud\xe9jar architecture, and secondly, viewed through the lens of its patron\u2019s identity and personal history, as a portal into the sociological underpinnings of fifteenth-century Spanish material culture.\n\n## Independent Scholarship for The Drawing Center\n\n### [Ruth Asawa\u2019s Early Watercolors: Revisiting the Visual Legacy of Japanese-American Concentration Camps](/pending-link)\n\nThis paper highlights two early watercolors produced by Japanese-American artist Ruth Asawa while she and her family were incarcerated in the Rohwer Relocation Center in Arkansas during World War II. The ideas, themes, and formal characteristics expressed in these watercolors relate to a broader visual culture emergent in Japanese-American Concentration Camps, and help contextualize Ruth Asawa\u2019s later work, both under the supervision of her mentors at Black Mountain College, and in her oeuvre of looped-wire sculpture.\n",escapeHtml:!1})})})})})}}}]);
