7:T50b,New York used to be the city that never sleeps. Sleepless, because at all hours, the rotating cast of hooligans there, perpetually motivated by their mutual fear of being outlived, outworked, and outloved by one another, drove themselves into a frenzied orbit around the clock. In the age of COVID, however, this closeness, this centripetal tension of companionship and competition has become a danger. What was once a well-oiled machine now has gravel in its gears. The friction of human closeness in the city threatens to burn it all up in a conflagration of disease, and we need reduced hours for shops, restaurants, and museums to pull apart the magnets of this electric motor before the machine overheats. Like the New York City of old, the internet now offers unlimited opportunities to spin each other up into absurd heights of manic activity. Unfortunately, when COVID introduced physical friction and decay to New York City, it also allowed mental, spiritual, and psychological dissolution to infiltrate infect our digital life. What was once a retreat from practical exhaustion has now become a refugee camp for the burnt-out, and there really aren't any more cocktail bars, house parties, or 24 hour diners to refresh us. To combat this, we need reduced hours on the internet too.0:{"P":null,"b":"fQlatSv7erBxYvaE_dYLM","c":["","studies"],"q":"","i":false,"f":[[["",{"children":["studies",{"children":["__PAGE__",{}]}]},"$undefined","$undefined",true],[["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","link","0",{"rel":"stylesheet","href":"/_next/static/chunks/6e2a9db44e72c93f.css","precedence":"next","crossOrigin":"$undefined","nonce":"$undefined"}],["$","script","script-0",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/61ff83bf48f4bdf8.js","async":true,"nonce":"$undefined"}]],["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":[["$","head",null,{"children":[["$","$L2",null,{}],["$","$L3",null,{}]]}],["$","body",null,{"children":[["$","$L4",null,{}],["$","section",null,{"className":"hero is-fullheight-with-navbar","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"hero-body","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"container content","children":["$","$L5",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L6",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":404}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],[]],"forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]}]}]}]]}]]}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[null,["$","$L5",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L6",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","forbidden":"$undefined","unauthorized":"$undefined"}]]}],{"children":[["$","$1","c",{"children":[[["$","h1",null,{"children":"A Digital Home for the Covid Psyche, Encumberment Made Manifest"}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":"Public health strictures and lifestyle changes related to COVID-19 offer more than a new paradigm for social engagement—they crack open a rift into an exciting new world where digital logistics hang from our bones like sinewy flesh, each of us a marionette dancing along, suspended by strings of programming code.
