# Tomlin Tiki Empire

Duncan Tomlin is an award winning restaurateur that operates the following establishments:

## Minetta Mizzenmast

Surfing memorabilia, carpeted floors and the way-laid-back staff can bring a little endless summer to the gloomiest day. A full menu includes a variety of tiki classics. If you drop in to get the local surf forecast, chill out with a “tiki” cocktail like the Zombie, served in appropriately kitschy glassware.
