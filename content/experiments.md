# A Digital Home for the Covid Psyche, Encumberment Made Manifest

Public health strictures and lifestyle changes related to COVID-19 offer more than a new paradigm for social engagement—they crack open a rift into an exciting new world where digital logistics hang from our bones like sinewy flesh, each of us a marionette dancing along, suspended by strings of programming code. As in any world known to mortals, we find ourselves here passively encumbered by life’s quotidian annoyances: the moments that frustrate our soul’s wanton whims. Presently, the encumbrances of this digital world pertain mostly to lagging connectivity and confusing interfaces, the bottlenecks of software development. Imagine what might happen, however, if, as we stepped through this portal, we trailed with us some of the comfortingly familiar annoyances intrinsic to our formerly meaty lives? Think about stubbed toes, awkward glances, indigestion at the dinner table, etc. For the sake of transforming the digital world into a place that feels more like home, consider the following.

## [1. Reduced Hours](/experiments/1)

New York used to be the city that never sleeps. Sleepless, because at all hours, the rotating cast of hooligans there, perpetually motivated by their mutual fear of being outlived, outworked, and outloved by one another, drove themselves into a frenzied orbit around the clock. In the age of COVID, however, this closeness, this centripetal tension of companionship and competition has become a danger. What was once a well-oiled machine now has gravel in its gears. The friction of human closeness in the city threatens to burn it all up ina conflagration of disease, and we need reduced hours for shops, restaurants, and museums to pull apart the magnets of this electric motor before the machine overheats. Like the New York City of old, the internet now offers unlimited opportunities to spin each other up into absurd heights of manic activity. Unfortunately, when COVID introduced physical friction and decay to New York City, it also allowed mental, spiritual, and psychological dissolution to infiltrate infect our digital life. What was once a retreat from practical exhaustion has now become a refugee camp for the burnt-out, and there really aren't any more cocktail bars, house parties, or 24 hour diners to refresh us. To combat this, we need reduced hours on the internet too.

## [2. Decay](/experiments/2)

Depleted spaces where structures once stood, etc. New York has lost x% of its population, and the economic fallout of this loss reflected in declining tax revenue of y% over 2019 and 2020 threatens to unravel the fabric of the city. At what percentage of itself does a fading thing retain its identity.

## [3. Social Distancing](/experiments/3)

Don't forget to stay 6 feet apart. -

## [4. Maximum Occupancy](/experiments/4)

Our lives in the real world are mediated by the spaces we inhabit. This is also true online, but we  don't conceive of these spaces as physically bounded. They could be. This study explores the intrinsic limitation imposed by our presence, even in a virtual world. (build please wait outside alert with max occupancy of 1)

## [5. Out of Stock](/experiment/5)

Supply chains in the real world are threatened by sudden changes in group behavior. You may imagine that the internet has no commodity bottlenecks, but you'd be wrong in this case. In fact, so many people are seeking out this content at present, that we regret to inform you we will be expecting our next restock in x days.

## [6. Timed Entry](/experiment/6)

Time is a valuable resource, and like so many other limitations imposed by our pandemic response, you must share a schedule divided among your peers. Please take a timed ticket before proceeding. Your time spent on this page counts against your alloted total.
