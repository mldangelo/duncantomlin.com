# My 2020 in Review

It [Started out grand](https://youtu.be/rWmQhrVUWo0) with a whole bunch of [surfing](https://www.instagram.com/p/B9Nu0DXgw5xBKUKjn_XER-DoytOJsOFmn1rGLA0/). Also my exhibition at The Drawing Center was rockin' in the early days there.

Then, obviously, there was a period of time where things sucked. I had to leave mags behind to travel home for quarantine, and I lived alone in a [basement](https://www.instagram.com/p/B-JGbuSA0x7/?igshid=19kyv1hy3khyd).

While I was down there, I got back into making music [mixes](https://www.mixcloud.com/duncan-tomlin/new-mix/)

Suddenly, it became clear that there was much I still needed to learn about race in America. George Floyd's death and the Black Lives Matter movement pushed us to grapple with systemic racism, and in my own way, I tried to meditate and act on my responsibility as a person with privilege. Part of this process of learning and listening, was, again, [music-related](https://www.mixcloud.com/duncan-tomlin/friend-sourced-mix-to-fundraise-for-racial-justice/) for me, with the goal of turning intentionality into fundraising.

I went back to New York eventually, where mags and I went on a couple distancing-friendly outdoor trips - hiking, surfing, etc.

Oh yeah, somewhere in there I started working on getting into architecture school, so we'll see how that goes.

The year kinda slammed shut with successive waves of covid and then whatever the fu*k happened at the capitol (more racism, etc.) but yeah, I'm hanging in there, waiting to see how it goes next year, I guess. Lucky to have my health :)
