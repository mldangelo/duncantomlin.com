### [Life After Death: The Chapel of San Jerónimo in Toledo](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i688jt-W0QcG9Ev_Eq8S499TUw3Qz4-DPFs-d_0tYHo/edit?usp=sharing)

This paper discusses the formal characteristics of the Chapel of San Jerónimo within the 
Convent of the Concepcionistas in Toledo, Castile-La Mancha, Spain. In light of its remarkably heterogeneous program of ornamentation, including references to visual traditions that span the multicultural, multiconfessional history of the Iberian Peninsula, the chapel’s design merits consideration, firstly, as a unique contribution to the canon of Castilian mudéjar architecture, and secondly, viewed through the lens of its patron’s identity and personal history, as a portal into the sociological underpinnings of fifteenth-century Spanish material culture.

### [Ruth Asawa’s Early Watercolors: Revisiting the Visual Legacy of Japanese-American Concentration Camps](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fYCOQYkZkE1K6pH4lIOi774ZPwXqZj6YKTlQGRWju0I/edit?usp=sharing)

This paper highlights two early watercolors produced by Japanese-American artist Ruth Asawa while she and her family were incarcerated in the Rohwer Relocation Center in Arkansas during World War II. The ideas, themes, and formal characteristics expressed in these watercolors relate to a broader visual culture emergent in Japanese-American Concentration Camps, and help contextualize Ruth Asawa’s later work, both under the supervision of her mentors at Black Mountain College, and in her oeuvre of looped-wire sculpture.
