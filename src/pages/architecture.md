What was the point of all this? 

Why,... to build a better Columbia campus, of course! More immediately, to learn Rhino and some other software, and to engage in studio culture and "crit" for what amounts to the first time in a serious architectural setting.

The fact of the matter is this: although it was unlikely that an introductory course would enable me to produce viable schematics worthy of the campus development committee's time, the ideas presented in this portfolio might conceivably garner enough attention, either for their outlandish scope or for their metastasizing mushroom metaphors, to inspire some degree of reflection on the attributes of light and shadow, access and privacy, that pervade the campus' program. TBD.
